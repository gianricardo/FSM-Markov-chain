# FSM-Markov-chain
This project aims from a FSM (Finite State Machine), representing a Markov chain, to generate and rank the test cases. The test cases are ranked according to the sequence probability, ie the product of the probabilities of the arcs traversed. It is important to remember that, Markov chain describes a process in which the transition to a state at time t + 1 depends only on the state at time t.
